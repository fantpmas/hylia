After tiling the bathroom floor we decided to put the washing machine and dryer in a dedicated closet. Made out of plywood, what else!

Used glue and biscuit joints for the visible joints and glue and screws where possible.

Shelf pin holes were drilled using my Wolfcraft doweling jig.

Routed out grooves for the Hettich sliding door system that I used previously on another cabinet. The hardware fits nicely into a standard 35 mm hole.

Self-centering drill bits are awesome.

Hinges for the hanging cupboard are soft-closing ones by Hettich too.

Routed out a section to pass the power cord through and is also used as ventilation area.

Glue-up had to be done on site as the finished cupboard would not fit through the door. And bringing it up the stairs would've been a bloody nightmare.

## Lessons learned
- Only cut the doors to final size once the carcass is finished
- Use a sharp blade to cut plywood
- Cutting a full sheet of plywood to precise dimensions is surprisingly hard work, even on the massive sliding table saw we use in the class shop
